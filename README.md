Generate an SBV file for a youtube video where you want to add subtitles

*Note*: This assumes you have a transcript of a Youtube video ready already

First, paste a link to any YouTube video you want to add captions for. 
Once you click on the "Put video" button, the video will appear on top 
and the other buttons will be enabled.

Next, paste the transcript (or text) that you want to display alongside
the video in the text-box provided on the left. Each new display of text
must be separated by a newline.

Once you start playing the video, each time you click on the "Add subtitle"
button, it will remove one line from the top of the transcript, and add it
as a timed message to the text on the right.
